------Task contributor function-------
Problems: 
     1. How to add someone to the task? - done
    -soln:
        Done - 1. Create a contributors model Contributors: [{contributorId,    status: ('invited', 'accepted', declined, retired), dateInvited, dateAccepted, dateRetired}] 

     2. How to reflect that to user that he was invited to the task? - done
    -soln: 
        1. Create an endpoint /api/getInvites/ 
    

    3. How to accept or not accept task by someon - done
    Done - Accepting
    DOne -  Decline

    4. How show all contributors of task - done
    -soln: populate with users that has a status of contributors.status === accepted

    5. How to show all assigned tasks of users - done
    - after fetching all user created task, query all task where he is a contributor then mix it in one array? or separate it  by creating a personal task and group task?

    [...{personal task}, ...{assigned task}] i think separating is much better. 
    [...{assigned task}], [...{personal task}]

6. Create function that allow contributors to update the task(authentication).
    soln: this will a middleware
